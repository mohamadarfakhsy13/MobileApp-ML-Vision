# Custom TensorFlow Lite Models

If you have downloaded a model from TensorFlow Hub or have trained an image classifier with TensorFlow Lite Model Maker you can implement it in one of two ways depending on the composition of the input image. If it contains:

A scene or the object you are trying to detect takes up most of the input image, e.g. a landmark, use image classifier function in:
ML Kit Image Labeling for Custom Model, or
Android Studio 4.1 ML Model Binding
A particular object among many objects in the frame, e.g. detecting a product in a busy supermarket, use ML Kit Object Detection and Tracking for Custom Model
For non-image classifier use-cases, refer to the TensorFlow Lite example apps on how to implement custom TensorFlow Lite models in various use cases ranging from Style Transfer to Question and Answer.
